Project Plan
--------


Project Title: Jumpy Hawk




Provide a one paragraph description of your project:
Block flying in air that can jump at push of a button. Gravity affects it. Must go through holes randomly placed on successive, evenly spaced walls. Score is number of holes passed through, kept track on the HEX display. Game is displayed on VGA monitor.




What is your plan for the first week?
Jason: Have a gravity effect on the block
Yatzu: FSM: Reset, Falling, Rising
Adil, Yifei: Walls moving towards left side of screen


What is your plan for the second week?
Jason, Yatzu: Have a jump action for the block
Adil, Yifei: Walls have 1 hole in them randomly placed in wallt


What is your plan for the third week?
Jason, Yatzu: Game stops when block collides with wall
Adil, Yifei: Score increases when block passes through hole




What is your backup plan if things don't work out as planned?
Block Game. Coloured block only has vertical movement. Must pass through block of same colour in 4 block wall. Can change colour by passing coloured lines






Weekly Reports
--------------
<In this space, provide a report each week of what worked and what didn't, and what (if any) changes were made to your proposal)>




[This is an example of a report where things didn't go so well.]
Week 1: 
        We added and tested the sensors and the main FSM. 
        The distance sensor we had intended to use didn't work as expected (wasn't precise enough at further distances, only seems to work accurately within 5-10cm), so instead we've decided to change the project to use a light sensor instead.
        Had trouble getting the FSM to work (kept getting stuck in state 101, took longer to debug than expected), so we may not be able to add the high score feature. We have updated that in the project description as an optional feature.
