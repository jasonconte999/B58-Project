What is your plan for the first week?
Jason: Have a gravity effect on the block
Yatzu: FSM: Reset, Falling, Rising
Adil, Yifei: Walls moving towards left side of screen


What is your plan for the second week?
Jason, Yatzu: Have a jump action for the block
Adil, Yifei: Walls have 1 hole in them randomly placed in wallt


What is your plan for the third week?
Jason, Yatzu: Game stops when block collides with wall
Adil, Yifei: Score increases when block passes through hole

Weekly Reports
--------------
<In this space, provide a report each week of what worked and what didn't, and what (if any) changes were made to your proposal)>

Week 1:
        Our initial goals didn't account for how our modules were to be structured. Tasks were split into more logical modules and reassigned.
        Yatzu, Yifei: created and tested control_bird, control_wall, and check_touched
        Adil:
        Jason: draw_rect (fully tested), datapath_bird (partially designed)
